## My process

First created the HTML structure.
Slowly added the CSS elements.
First the positioning elements were used.
Later the font elements were corrected.
Afterwards, The colors were correctly assigned.
Hover transitions were added.
Lastly, some finishing touches were given.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to structure HTML using div and assign elements using div tag.
Transition elements, pseudo-classes, flexbox and some other CSS elements were a new learning experience.

### Continued development

I would improve my HTML structuring using more tags like header, footer, main, section, etc.
Further knowledge about transition and flexbox and other elements need to be learned and applied properly.
Need to implement variables and further optimize my code.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me for CSS and pseudo-elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for CSS and flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
